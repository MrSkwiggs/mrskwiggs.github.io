Hey there, it's been a while ðŸ‘‹

> There's a link at the end of this post, keep reading if you wanna try this one for yourself!

Well this post is a quick update to share that I'e recently picked up work on an app idea I've had for a couple years now; using your iPhone as a webcam!

## Introducing StreamCam

I've wanted to work on something like this for the past 3-4 years, but unfortunately lacked the technologies (open-source frameworks) to do this. My idea was to run a webserver on iOS devices and that was no easy feat!

Until earlier this year, when [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) introduced iOS support!

So I've been hard at work during my (very limited, I'm sure you know how it is) free time and have finally reached a state where I feel it's ready for the public eye!

So if this sounds like something interesting, I'm actually running a public [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/G2nWjlsH). Use this link to sign up!

In the not-so-distant future, the app will offer a small in-app purchase to unlock higher streaming quality/output resolution. But basic usage (at a somewhat reduced quality) will remain free forever. And without ads.

If you do sign up for the beta, I'd love to hear your thoughts & feedback.
